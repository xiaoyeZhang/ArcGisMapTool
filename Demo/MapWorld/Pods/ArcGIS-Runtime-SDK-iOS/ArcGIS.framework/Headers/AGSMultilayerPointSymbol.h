/** @brief A multilayer point symbol
 
 Instances of this class represent multilayer point symbols. These symbols are composed of multiple layers of symbols which are rendered as one symbol with a point geometry. Each symbol layer has its own properties like offset, anchor, rotation which can be combined to create a point symbol with special effects. e.g concentric circles or a pushpin effect.
