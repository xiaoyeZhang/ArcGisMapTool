/** @brief A layer based on a dynamic ArcGIS Map service.
 
 Instances of this class allow you to display maps from a dynamic ArcGIS Map service. For example, http://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer
 A dynamic map service generates map images on the fly.
