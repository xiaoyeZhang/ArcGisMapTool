/** @brief An object representing a registered user of the portal or organization. 
 
 AGSPortalUser represents a registered user of a portal or organization. A Portal may have users who are
 unaffiliated with an organization or users who are part of an organization. Users sign in to the portal 
 and create and share content which is organized into Items (@c AGSPortalItem). Users can create and 
 join Groups (@c AGSPortalGroup) and share items with Groups. This makes the items visible and 
 accessible to other members of the Group. Users could be in different roles including administrators, 
 publishers and  information workers. Administrators can add  users to  their organizations and have 
 access to all content within the organization. All users can create web maps based  on mashing up 
 services that they have access to and can register services running on external servers. Publishers 
 within an organization can in addition create hosted services based on data files that they upload.
