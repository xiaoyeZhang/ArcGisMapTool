/** @brief A polyline barrier to constrain routes
 
 Instances of this class represent a polyline barrier that can be used to constrain routes generated by `AGSRouteTask` or service areas generated by `AGSServiceAreaTask`.
 
 Barriers serve to temporarily restrict, add impedance (cost) to, and scale impedance on parts of the transportation network.
