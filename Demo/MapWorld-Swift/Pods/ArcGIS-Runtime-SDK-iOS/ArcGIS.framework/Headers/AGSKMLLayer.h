/** @brief A layer that can display KML data
 
 An instance of this class represents a layer based on a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file (.kml,.kmz file extension). 
 KML is an XML-based container for geographic information. For more information about KML and how to create a KML file,
 please refer to the [Google documentation](http://developers.google.com/kml/documentation). KML data is typically
 composed of one or more KML node elements such as documents, folders, placemarks, network links or overlays -
 arranged hierarchically in a tree structure that's represented by the `AGSKMLDataset`.

 
 A KML Layer can be used to display KML data in both 2D and 3D using an `AGSMapView` or an `AGSSceneView` respectively.
