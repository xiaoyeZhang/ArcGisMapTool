/** @brief Analysis of visibility along a line between two geo-elements
 
 Instances of this class represent an analysis object that evaluates visibility along a line defined by observer and target geo-element objects.
 
 The result of the analysis is a line between the observer and the target geo-element (each using Point geometry). Visible and obstructed portions of the line are displayed with unique colors (green and red by default). The observer and/or target may be moving, in which case visibility will be dynamically updated.
 
 @note The geo-elements must have a point geometry
