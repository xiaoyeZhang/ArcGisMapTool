/** @brief A marker symbol based on an image
 
 Instances of this class represent picture marker symbols. Symbols describe how graphics and features
 look on a map. Different symbols are used with different geometry
 types.  Marker symbols are used to display those graphics and features which are based on
 point or multipoint geometries. Picture marker symbols display graphics using a picture image.
