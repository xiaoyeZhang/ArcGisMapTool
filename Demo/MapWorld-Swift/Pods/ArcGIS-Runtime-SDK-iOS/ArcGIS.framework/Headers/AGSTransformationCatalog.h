/** @brief A class for discovering and managing transformations
 
 This class represent a catalog of available geographic transformation that can be used to covert between datums. It provides a mechanism for discovering available transformations. You can retrieve the default transformation or the best available transformation. The area of interest may be taken into account.
 
 This class also allows you to set the location where Projection Engine data files needed for some transformations are found on local storage. The `#setProjectionEngineDirectory:error:` must be called upon application startup to specify the location before using any other Runtime API.
 
 The default transformation used is the most suitable one across the area covered by the input and output spatial references. You can sometimes get a more suitable transformation by specifying the extent of your specific work area.
