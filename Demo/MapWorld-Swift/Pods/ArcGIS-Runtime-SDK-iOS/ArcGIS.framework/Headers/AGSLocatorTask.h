/** @brief A task to geocode and reverse-geocode addresses and places
 
 Instances of this class represent a task used to convert an address to a point (geocode) or vice-versa (reverse geocode). It also supports finding well known places and points of interest, and can provide suggestions character-by-character as a user types.
 
 The task can be created for an ArcGIS Geocode service hosted in the cloud on ArcGIS Online or on-premises with ArcGIS Server. The task can also be created for a locator dataset stored locally on the device in which case it can used even when the device has no network connectivity.
