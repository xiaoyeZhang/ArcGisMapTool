/** @brief An iOS app delegate for handling app events related to actions initiated by ArcGIS classes
 
 An instance of this class represents an application delegate that can handle application related events that are of interest to or initiated by ArcGIS classes.
 
 The methods in this class are designed to mirror those in Apple's `UIApplicationDelegate`. You should call them in the respective methods in your application delegate's implementation so that ArcGIS classes can respond to application events.

/** Provides a way to process @c NSURLSession related events for data downloaded in the background.
 The download could have been initiated in the background by @c #application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:, or it might have been initiated in the
 foreground and the app later terminated or moved into the background.
 This method should be called in the <code>-[UIApplicationDelegate application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:]</code> delegate method. 
 Once the download finishes, the completion handler on your @c AGSGDBSyncTask or @c AGSExportTileCacheTask will be invoked to let you know that the job has
 completed. If your app is still in the background, you can post a local notification to alert the user.
