 Instances of this class represent a source for `AGSArcGISMapImageSublayer` based on a SQL query of dataset, such as non-spatial table, feature class, or raster, that resides in a registered workspace of the ArcGIS Map Service. The workspace can be either a folder or geodatabase.

 If a single integer field is specified, the service uses the values in that field directly to uniquely identify all features and rows returned from a queryTable. However, if a single string field or a group of fields is used as the unique identifier, map server maps those unique values to an integer.
 Since the value in the unique identifier field uniquely identifies a row or feature object, values in that field must always be unique and not null.  Operations will behave unpredictably when non-unique or null values are encountered. It is your responsibility to guarantee that values in this field meet this requirement. The service does not enforce the uniqueness of values in the unique identifier field of a queryTable. If multiple fields are chosen, the values in these fields will be used as a key to generate a unique integer value. This resultant field is always called ESRI_OID unless a field of that name already exists.
