/**
 @brief A polygon geometry representing an area or collection of areas.
 
 Instances of this class represent a polygon geometry. A polygon is defined by a collection of parts (closed rings). Each ring is a bounded area represented by a collection of points. The first and last points of a ring must coincide so that the ring is closed. Each point represents a vertex of the polygon, defined by a pair of x,y coordinates, and optionally a z-coordinate and/or m-value (measure).
 
 A polygon is associated with a spatial reference which specifies the coordinate system that its coordinate values use.

 @since 100
 @note This class represents an immutable polygon geometry, it cannot be modified after being created. Use `#toBuilder:` to get a polygon builder using a copy of this geometry as a starting off point. The builder can then be modified to produce a new geometry.

 @see `AGSPolygonBuilder`  to construct or modify polygons programmatically.
 @see `AGSSketchEditor` to construct or modify geometries interactively by sketching on a map.
 @see `AGSGeometryEngine` to perform operations on geometries.
