/** @brief A task to compute routes and turn-by-turn directions
 
 Instances of this class represent a task used to compute routes and turn-by-turn directions. It allows you to find a variety of routes between any given locations - the quickest, shortest, most scenic, and so on. The route returned depends on the impedance chosen by you. For example, if the impedance is time, then the best route is the quickest route. Hence, the best route can be defined as the route that has the lowest impedance. 
 
 The task can be created for an ArcGIS Network Analyst service hosted in the cloud on ArcGIS Online or on-premises with ArcGIS Server. The task can also be created for a transportation network dataset stored locally on the device in which case it can used even when the device has no network connectivity.
