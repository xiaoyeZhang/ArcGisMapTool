/** @brief A renderer to display heatmaps

 Instances of this class represent renderers that can display heat maps which represent the geographic density of features on a map. The relative density is displayed using a color scheme that smoothly varyies a set of colors ranging from cool (low density of points) to hot (high density of points).  Heat map symbology is a dynamic raster surface that changes as you zoom in and out. For example, if you map a city's crime hot spots, zooming out shows a bigger picture of criminal activity across the city, while zooming in shows more detailed density patterns in particular neighborhoods without having to change any symbology properties.
