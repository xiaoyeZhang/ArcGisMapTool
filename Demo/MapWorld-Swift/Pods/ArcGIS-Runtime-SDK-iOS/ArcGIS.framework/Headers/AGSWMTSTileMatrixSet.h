/** @brief An OGC-WMTS service tile matrix set
 
 Instances of this class represent a tile matrix set in an OGC-WMTS map service, for example, http://v2.suite.opengeo.org/geoserver/gwc/service/wmts .
 
 A tile matrix set defines the geometry of the tiled space.  Each tile matrix set contains one
 or more "tile matrices" defining the tiles that are available for that coordinate reference
 system. The tile matrix set specifies : 
 
 * The scale of the tiles as a scale denominator.
 * The width and height of each tile in pixels
 * The top left (minimum x, maximum y) corner of the bounding box of the tile matrix
 * The width and height of the tile matrix in tile units (i.e., number of tiles)
