/**
 @brief Parts of a multipart geometry (`AGSMultipart`).
 
 Instances of this class represent the parts of a multipart geometry (`AGSMultipart`). For example, polygons have multiple parts where each part is a ring and polylines have multiple parts where each part is a line.
 
 This class adopts `%NSFastEnumeration` which permits the collection to be enumerated conveniently using a for-in loop. For example -
 
 ``` Swift
 let collection:AGSPartCollection = ... //A collection of parts
 for part in collection {
 //do something
 }
 ```
 This class also provides subscripting support. So you can access segments using the subscript syntax. For example -
 
 ``` Swift
 let collection:AGSPartCollection = ... //A collection of parts
 let part = collection[0] //The part at 0th index
 ```

 
 @since 100
 @see `AGSMultipart` for multipart geometries
