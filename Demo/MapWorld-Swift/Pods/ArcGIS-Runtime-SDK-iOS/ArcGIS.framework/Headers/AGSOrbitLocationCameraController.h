/** @brief A controller which allows a scene view's camera to orbit a fixed location
 
 Instances of this class represent a controller which allows a scene view's camera to orbit a stationary target location. Interactions on the scene view will pivot the camera around the target so that the camera is always looking at the target.
 
 To activate this controller, you need to set it on the scene view using `AGSSceneView#cameraController`. Programmatically setting the viewpoint on the scene view will be disabled when this controller is active.
