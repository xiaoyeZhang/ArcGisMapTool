/**
 @brief A builder to build envelope geometries.
 
 Instances of this class represent a builder that can build envelope geometries.
 Envelope geometries are immutable, they cannot be modified after they are created. Use builders to create new geometries either from scratch, or by using an existing geometry as a starting off point. Modifications made through the builder affect only its own internal copy of the geometry. They do not affect the original geometry.

 
 @since 100
 @see `AGSSketchEditor` to construct or modify geometries interactively by sketching on a map
