/** @brief A job to export a tile cache or item resource cache from an ArcGIS Vector Tile service.
 
 Instances of this class represent a long running job on a remote server that can export a tile cache from an ArcGIS Vector Tile service. The job can also export an item resource cache containing custom style resources from a portal item that represents an ArcGIS Vector Tile service.
 
 A job is initiated when it is submitted to the server. See `#startWithStatusHandler:completion:`.
 
 When the server accepts the job, it assigns a unique ID to the job which is avialable in `AGSJob#serverJobID`. The client then periodically polls for the status of the job on the server and provides this information in the status handler. If the job completes successfully, the result of the job is downloaded and provided in the completion handler, otherwise an error is provided when the job fails.
