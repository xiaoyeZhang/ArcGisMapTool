/** @brief A KML Network Link element
 
 An instance of this class represents a KML `<NetworkLink>` element which references
 a KML file or KMZ archive on a local or remote network.
 
 @note A KML network link can have a refresh interval defined to enable regular refresh of data.
 Alternatively, KML network links support a view refresh mode, which fetches network links based on the visible extent.
 @since 100.4
