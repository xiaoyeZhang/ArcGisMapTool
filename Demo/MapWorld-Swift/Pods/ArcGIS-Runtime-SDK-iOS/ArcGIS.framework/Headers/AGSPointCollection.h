 @brief Vertices of a single part of a multipart geometry (`AGSMultipart`).
 
 Instances of this class represent the vertices of a single part of a multipart geometry (`AGSMultipart`). For example, polygons have multiple parts where each part is a ring and polylines have multiple parts where each part is a line. Each part is composed of a sequence of points. All points must have the same spatial reference.
