/** @brief A symbol style
 
 Instances of this class represent a symbol style that is based on a .stylx file (a sqlite database from ArcGIS Pro containing symbols)
 
 When used by itself, a symbol style supports two key workflows. The first is to find a symbol with provided key values. This is done by creating an array of key fields, and passing those into `#symbolForKeys:completion:`, which returns a new symbol. In this case, the key is the value associated to the symbol in the .stylx file. You might use this symbol to create a new Graphic.
 
 You can also use a standalone symbol style to search for symbol primitives. Symbol primitives are the individual symbols that make up more complex symbols. This is achieved using `#searchSymbolsWithParameters:completion:`. You could create a symbol picker app that searches for all symbols that have the tag "maritime" in it. The search results contain symbols which you could then either use as they are or extract from them different individual symbols to create a new composite symbol.

/** Find a symbol in the .stylx file based on the supplied keys. This function is useful for obtaining or assembling a single multilayer symbol from a list of one or more keys and provides a convenient way to create symbols on the fly. Each symbol in a mobile style file (.stylx) has a unique key. If you need one symbol from the file, you can provide a list with just the single key. If you want to combine several symbols from the file into one multilayer symbol, however, you can provide a list with all keys for symbols to combine.
 
 For example, assume XYZ stylx file has a symbol with key "abc" which is the central symbol and another symbol with key "pqr", which could be the modifier/echelon placed at some offset from central geometry. So if you provide these two keys as attributes then symbol style will find and assemble a multi-layer symbol accordingly.
