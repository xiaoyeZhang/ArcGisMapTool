/** @brief Represents a group within the Portal or Organization.
 
 An Instance of this class resource represents a group within the Portal or Organization. The owner is 
 automatically an administrator and is returned in the list of admins. Adminstrators can invite, add to
 or remove members from a group as well as update or delete the group. The administrator for an 
 organization may also reassign the group to another member of the organization. Group members may leave
 the group. Authenticated users may apply to join a group.
