/** @brief A layer to display basemap contents of a mobile map package
 
 Instances of this class represent a layer that can visualize vector/feature data in the basemap of a mobile map package (.mmpk file). It represents multiple feature layers from a geodatabase which are rendered together in a group to form a vector basemap. This layer abstracts the complexity of 100's of layers into a simple to use basemap layer.
