/** @brief A task to calculate service areas
 
 Instances of this class represent tasks that can calculate service areas. Service areas show which roads can be reached within a given distance or travel time. A service area can help you answer the following types of questions:
 
 @li How far can I drive from here in 5 minutes?
 @li What areas are covered within a 3-mile drive distance of my stores?
 @li What areas are within 4 minutes of our hospitals?
 
 Creating a service area is like buffering a point. However, when you buffer a point, you specify a straight-line distance, and a circle is created to show the area that is within that distance. In contrast, when you create a service area around a point, it represents the maximum distance that can be traveled along a network, such as a road network. The result is a service area covering the roads that can be reached within the distance you specified.
 
 
 The task can be created for an ArcGIS Network Analyst service hosted in the cloud on ArcGIS Online or on-premises with ArcGIS Server.
