/** @brief A controller which allows a scene view's camera to orbit a geo-element
 
 Instances of this class represent a controller which allows a scene view's camera to orbit a stationary or moving target geo-element. Interactions on the scene view will pivot the camera around the target so that the camera is always looking at the target. The camera will move to maintain a fixed relative distance from a moving target, and it can even adjust its heading, pitch, and roll based on changes to geo-element's heading, pitch, and roll.
 
 To activate this controller, you need to set it on the scene view using `AGSSceneView#cameraController`. Programmatically setting the viewpoint on the scene view will be disabled when this controller is active.
