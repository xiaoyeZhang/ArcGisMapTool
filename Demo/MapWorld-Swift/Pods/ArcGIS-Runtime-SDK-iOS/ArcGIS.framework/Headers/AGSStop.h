/** @brief A stop along a route
 
 Instances of this class represent stops - locations that must be visited along a route. Stops are part of  `AGSRouteParameters` which is used as input to `AGSRouteTask#solveRouteWithParameters:completion:`. You need atleast two stops to compute a route, although you can have more.
