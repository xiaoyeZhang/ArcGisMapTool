/** @brief A task to find facilities closest to an incident
 
 Instances of this class represent tasks that can find the closest facilities around any location (incidents) on a network. Finding the closest hospital to an accident, the closest police cars to a crime scene, and the closest store to a customer's address are all examples of closest facility problems. When finding closest facilities, you can specify how many to find and whether the direction of travel is toward or away from them. Once you've found the closest facilities, you can display the best route to or from them, return the travel cost for each route, and display directions to each facility. Additionally, you can specify an impedance cutoff beyond which the task should not search for a facility. For instance, you can set up a closest facility problem to search for hospitals within 15 minutes drive time of the site of an accident. Any hospitals that take longer than 15 minutes to reach will not be included in the results.
 
 The task can be created for an ArcGIS Network Analyst service hosted in the cloud on ArcGIS Online or on-premises with ArcGIS Server.
