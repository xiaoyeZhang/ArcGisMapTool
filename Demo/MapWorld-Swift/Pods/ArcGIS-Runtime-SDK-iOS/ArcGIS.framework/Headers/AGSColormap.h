/** @brief A colormap to display raster data as either a grayscale or color image.
 
 An instance of this class represents a colormap to display raster data as either a grayscale or color image.
 
 Colormaps help to associate a pixel value with a corresponding color. The pixel value is specified by the index of the color in the colormap. So, a color at index 0 in the colormap will be used to paint all the pixels that have a value of 0 in the raster.
