/** @brief Travel options for routes generated by `AGSRouteTask`
 
 Instances of this class represent options that can be used to customize the routes generated by `AGSRouteTask`, `AGSClosestFacilityTask`, or `AGSServiceAreaTask`.
 
 A default list of travel modes is available on `AGSRouteTaskInfo#travelModes`, `AGSClosestFacilityTaskInfo#travelModes` or`AGSServiceAreaTaskInfo#travelModes` based on the options supported by the underlying network analyst service or transportation network dataset.
