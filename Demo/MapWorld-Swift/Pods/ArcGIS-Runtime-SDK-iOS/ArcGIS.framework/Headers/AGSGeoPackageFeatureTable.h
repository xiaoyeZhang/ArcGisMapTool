/** @brief A dataset in a GeoPackage containing geographic features or non-spatial records
 
 Instances of this class respresent a dataset in a GeoPackage that could include either geographic features or non-spatial records. You can query the dataset using attribute or spatial criteria, and if permitted, also edit the data. If the dataset contains geographic features you can display them on a map using `AGSFeatureLayer`.
 
 It supports core GeoPackage geometry types and represents them as Point, Multipoint, Polyline, or Polygon. The GeoPackage specification supports a geometry collection type (storing a variety of core geometry types in a single table). For these tables, ArcGIS Runtime renders the first geometry type found in the collection. All features can be queried in the table regardless of the geometry type displayed.
