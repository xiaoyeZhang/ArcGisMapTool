/** @brief A map containing 2D geographic content
 
 Instance of this class represent a map. It can be displayed on the screen by `AGSMapView`.
 Thus, a map represents the model in an MVC architecture, and a mapview represents the view.  A map specifies how the geographic data is organized, and a mapview renders the data and allows users to interact with it.
 
 Conceptually, a map's geographic content is derived from its `#basemap` and `#operationalLayers`.
 
 A basemap helps orient the user and provides a geographical context for the content you want to display in the map. It is used for locational reference and provides a framework on which you can overlay operational layers. Thus, the basemap serves as a foundation and provides a framework for working with information geographically. It's content is typically static and does not change frequently. For eg, streets, parcel boundaries, or geographic features such as rivers. Some basemaps also contain reference layers, such as labels, which are drawn on top of operational layers.
 
 Operational layers provide content that is of unique interest to the application and the task at hand. Their content might change frequently. For eg earthquakes, traffic, or the weather.
 
 The map has a `#spatialReference` which specifies how the geographic content from its basemap and operational layers is aligned when combined together.

 Spatial references define where coordinates are located on the earth's surface and how the geographic content from the basemap and operational layers is aligned when combined together.
 
 If a spatial reference wasn't provided when the map was instantiated, it is typically derived from the bottom-most base layer in the basemap. If the map does not have a basemap or if the basemap is empty, the spatial reference is derived from the bottom-most operational layer.
 
 If the spatial reference of layers is different from that of the map, the layers must be reprojected to the spatial reference of the map before displaying. Some layers may not be able to re-project their data, for example layers based on tiles that have been pre-generated ahead of time. To maximize performance, avoid reprojection entirely by ensuring all layers have the same spatial reference as the map.
