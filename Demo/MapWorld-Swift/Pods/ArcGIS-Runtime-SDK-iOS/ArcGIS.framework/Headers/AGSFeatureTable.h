/** @brief A source for dataset containing geographic features or non-spatial records
 
 Subclasses represent a source for dataset that could include either geographic features or non-spatial records. You can query the dataset using attribute or spatial criteria, and if permitted, also edit the data. If the dataset contains geographic features you can display them on a map using `AGSFeatureLayer`.
