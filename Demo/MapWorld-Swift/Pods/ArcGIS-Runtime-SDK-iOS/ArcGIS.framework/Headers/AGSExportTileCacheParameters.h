 An `AGSPolygon` or `AGSEnvelope` geometry that defines the geographic area for which tiles are needed. Where an `AGSPolygon` is supplied, tiles will be filtered according to the polygon geometry, which can help reduce the size of the resulting tile package. Note that the filtered set of tiles may vary, depending on the underlying service.
 `AGSPoint` and `AGSPolyline` geometries are not supported. If this is not specified, the full extent of the service will be used.

 The value cannot be greater than the default compression quality already set on the service. For example, if the default value is 75, the value provided must be between 0 and 75. A value greater than 75 in this example will attempt to up sample an already compressed tile and will further degrade the quality of tiles.
 
 Providing a value smaller than the default set on the service will result in greater compression being applied to the tiles to reduce size, but may also degrade quality.
