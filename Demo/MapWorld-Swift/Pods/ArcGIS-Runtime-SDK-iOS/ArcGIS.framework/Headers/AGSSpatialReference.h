/**
 @brief Represents the spatial reference of a geometry.
 
 A spatial reference determines how map coordinates, or the x,y,z-coordinates in the vertices of geometries, correspond to locations in real-world space. Therefore, it is very important to associate geometries representing spatial data with corresponding spatial references.
 
 Each spatial reference can be represented by either a well-known ID (WKID), or a well-known text (WKT). Spatial references define the spatial properties of a geometry, for instance the coordinate system it uses. There are 2 broad classes of coordinate systems - Geographic & Projected. A Geographic Coordinate system uses a 3-dimensional spherical surface to define locations on the earth. A Projected Coordinate system on the other hand uses a flat, 2-dimensional surface.

/**
 Calculate the grid convergence for a spatial reference at a given point.
 
 Remarks
 The grid convergence is the angle between True North and Grid North at a point on a map. The grid convergence can be used to convert a horizontal direction expressed as an azimuth in a geographic coordinate system (relative to True North) to a direction expressed as a bearing in a projected coordinate system (relative to Grid North), and vice versa.
 
 Sign convention
 The grid convergence returned by this method is positive when Grid North lies east of True North. The following formula demonstrates how to obtain a bearing (b) from an azimuth (a) using the grid convergence (c) returned by this method:
 b = a - c
 This sign convention is sometimes named the Gauss-Bomford convention.
 
 Other Notes
 - Returns 0 if the spatial reference is a geographic coordinate system.
 - Returns NAN if the point is outside the projection's horizon or on error.
 - If the point has no spatial reference, it is assumed to be in the given spatial reference.
 - If the point's spatial reference differs from the spatial reference given, it's location will be transformed automatically to the given spatial reference.
