/** @brief A part of a multipart geometry
 
  Instances of this class represent an individual part of a multipart geometry such as polygon or polyline. A part is a collection of segments that define the shape of the part. As a convenience, you can
   access points that represent the vertices of the part, instead of working with segments.
 
 This class adopts `%NSFastEnumeration` which permits the part's segments to be enumerated conveniently using a for-in loop. For example -
 
 ``` Swift
 let part:AGSPart = ... //A part containing segments
 for segment in part {
   //do something
 }
 ```
 
 This class also provides subscripting support. So you can access segments using the subscript syntax. For example -
 
 ``` Swift
 let part:AGSMutablePart = ... //A part containing segments
 let segment = part[0] //The segment at 0th index
 ```
